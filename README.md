## Repo Structure
```
Simple-Online-Course-System/webapps\webroot\WEB-INF\reportlets
â”œâ”€â”€ FrontEndWebsite (Asp.net Core 3.1 MVC)
â”œâ”€â”€ BackEndManager (.Net framework 4.8 WPF)
â”œâ”€â”€ Api (Asp.net Core 3.1 Web Api)
â””â”€â”€ DatabaseBackup (SQL Server)
```

The whole system consists of 4 parts:  

1. `FrontEndWebsite`: Users can browse the website through a web browser to view currently available courses, register an account, log in as a member, and add courses to the shopping cart.

2. `BackEndManager`: System administrators can manage student data and configure course offerings through a desktop application.

3. `Api`: Providing APIs for other front-end applications to integrate, achieving the same functionality as the MVC project website.

4. `DatabaseBackup`: Data is stored in a database for storage, and it contains a backup file to import to database.

 There're sets of testing data in `Simple-Online-Course-System/DatabaseBackup/TainanNet.bak`  
 Just restore it to SQL Server.

 Please use `Visual Studio` to open `Simple-Online-Course-System/BackEndManager/BackEndManager.sln`, 
 then start running.

 UserEmail: `admin@email.com`  
 Password: `123`

To create classes that users from website can browse and select, you need to follow the steps:

1. Go to `Teacher Management` : Create teachers' profile
2. Go to `Course Management` : Create Courses which define learning hours in a semester
3. Go to `Class Management` : Choose teachers and courses to create a class

Finally you would get the view bellow.
There're already couples of classes in backup, you can add additional one for yourself.

## FrontEndWebsite

Go to `Simple-Online-Course-System/FrontEndWebsite/FrontEndMVC`

Build and run the Asp.net MVC project to operate a website
``` powershell
cd Simple-Online-Course-System/FrontEndWebsite/FrontEndMVC
dotnet run

```

if it succeeded, the prompt would be like this
![mvcserver](./DocFile/mvcserver.png)

Go to browser and request `https://localhost:5001`

![mvcmain](./DocFile/mvcmain.png)

The main section shows the classes you just created!

## Api
The FrontEndWebsite(Asp.net MVC) is server side rendering by using `Razor` to display screen while I provided a web api to let front-end developer access this system.

``` powershell
cd Simple-Online-Course-System/Api/CourseApi
dotnet run

```

When running the Api, go to `Swagger` to test data manipulation.
```
http://localhost:5001/swagger
```

Url: `http://localhost:5001/api/Login`  
Method: `POST`  
Json Content ðŸ‘‡  
``` Json
{
  "email": "admin@email.com",
  "password": "123"
}
```

If login is successful, it will return `JWT Token`

Now, give it a try!

```
http://localhost:5001/api/Course
```

The advantage of using Web APIs is that it enables a separation of the front-end and back-end systems. By integrating with APIs and consuming JSON strings, front-end applications on various devices and developed with different programming languages can achieve the same functionality.
